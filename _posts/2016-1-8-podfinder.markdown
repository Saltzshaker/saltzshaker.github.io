                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>More than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonâ€™s patients have trouble controlling their movements from reaching for objects to simply walking across the room. These problems lead to loss of independence and reduced quality of life: sufferers often avoid activities outside of the home, leading to isolation and depression.
