                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I built an interactive web simulation of an early text editor interaction based on interactions described in Larry Teslerâ€™s essay, <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Tesler%20-%20A%20Personal%20History%20of%20Modeless%20Text%20Editing%20and%20Cut-Copy-Paste.pdf">A Personal History of Modeless Text Editing and Cut/Copy-Paste</a>. </p>
                <p>The simulation offers an alternate history of text editing, allowing users to see what it would have been like to have to move, delete, insert, replace and undo edits in a modal text editor.</p>

                <h2>Project Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    Because my project aimed to showcase the particularly poor user experience design of early modal text editors, my goal was not to improve the historical aspects of the user experience, but the educational aspects of the user experience, highlighting the clunkiness of the process in a deliberate way. <span class="highlight">In other words, my goal was to make a usable unusable interface.</span> I wanted the movement through verb and noun modes to be frustratingly slow and clunky, but also easily discoverable to the user, in terms of what they could or should do in each mode. 
                </p>
                <h2>Aesthetic</h2>
                   <p>I was inspired by GUI designs from the 1970s and 1980s, in particular the 1976 Xerox Smalltalk text editor and Xerox Bravo, the first WYSIWYG document preparation program.  My design incorporates the bitmap grayscale aesthetic and window layout of these early GUIs. For inspiration, I made a Pinterest board for retro GUIs. </p>
