                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Close (but not too close) explores the boundaries of personal and technological space. The image of a woman is back-projected on a white sheet. The viewer’s relationship with the projected woman changes depending on their proximity to her, leading them to work with her to find just the right distance for comfort.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>More than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s patients have trouble controlling their movements from reaching for objects to simply walking across the room. These problems lead to loss of independence and reduced quality of life: sufferers often avoid activities outside of the home, leading to isolation and depression.
