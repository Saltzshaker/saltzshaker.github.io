                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Amviewlate is an AR prototype designed to help people with Parkinson's Disease navigate environments using voice recognition and visual cues. Amviewlate was featured as a <span class="highlight">DevPost Staff Pick</span> from hundreds of hackathon entries.</p>

                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>More than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s patients have trouble controlling their movements from reaching for objects to simply walking across the room. These problems lead to loss of independence and reduced quality of life: sufferers often avoid activities outside of the home, leading to isolation and depression. At the start of the Hackathon, we asked ourselves, how can empower people with Parkison's to feel more comfortable engaging with the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>To begin, we conducted several guerilla interviews with friends and family who either suffered from, or knew people who suffered from Parkinson's Disease. Our guiding insight came after watching <a href="" target="_blank">Mileha Soneji's TED talk: Simple hacks for life with Parkinson's</a>. Through this and other research, we discovered that many of the limitations experienced by people with Parkinson’s disease can be overcome with perceptual tricks. While the pace of walking on a flat surface is staggered and interrupted, the continuous motion of using a staircase, or even the illusion of a staircase, can enable a person with Parkinson’s to walk with a regular gait. And while many encounter difficulty extending an arm to interact with an object, the introduction of a moving target provides an active stimulus that prompts a response. We thought: <span class="highlight">What if we take this painted staircase illusion and apply it anywhere in the world?</span></p>
