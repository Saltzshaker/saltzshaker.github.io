        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Filter Bubble Roulette tells five stories through point-of-view interviews with subjects from diverse backgrounds interacting with their news feed and a “Russian bot” pretending to be a Trump supporter. We created the project to investigate the separation of social media bubbles leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p> 
        <p>Filter Bubble Roulette is a virtual reality environment. Users interacting with the project toggle between stories and watch digital elements from each news feed float above the head of the interviewees and bot. Simultaneously, a voiceover plays. The interviewees describe what they see while scrolling through their news feed on their phones.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Filter Bubble Roulette tells five stories through point-of-view interviews with subjects from diverse backgrounds interacting with their news feeds, as well as a “Russian troll” pretending to be a Trump supporter. We created the project to investigate the separation of social media bubbles leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p> 
            
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                I recruited four interviewees on Craigslist. After respondents filled out surveys on their demographics, politics, and news habits, I selected a cross-section of people to interview representing different backgrounds. After each interview, I created digital environments populated with the media they described seeing and hearing in their bubbles.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>Users gaze on the "Next Bubble" button to switch between stories. The interviewees describe what they see while scrolling through their news feed on their phones, as well as their general attitudes around news media and politics while elements from their news feeds float above their heads. This includes interviewee-specific advertisements, from EDM music fest ads to ads for bunion treatment.</p>
                <p>In addition to the four "real" interview subjects, I created a Russian troll impersonating a Trump-supporting American. The content and text in "Martha's" bubble was all adapted from actual words and images shared by employees of the Internet Research Agency in Russia.</p>
