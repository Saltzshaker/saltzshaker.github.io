            <p>Hi, I'm Emily, UX Professional and media geek. I went from studying Linguistics and Russian literature to wrangling design and content for Bay Area startups. In 2017 I earned a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction at CMU, with a focus on emerging technology like including conversational user interfaces and virtual reality. I'm currently a UX designer for Bloomberg.</p>
